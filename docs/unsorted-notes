Don't bother trying to figure out what we may have until after the flop. Before that, we can have literally anything, so we can only really go off our hole-cards.

Don't bother trying to calc anything on the opponents hand until the turn. Before that, they can have literally anything.

Should it be biased to the pool? Probably. By that I mean if there are 3 hearts on the board, bias the odds toward that. This may happen in hand odds calculation tho.

For now, we're going to focus on deciding when to stay in and when to step out. If we can accurately predict our victory vs loss, betting will be made much easier.

Probably going to handle the agent's decision making via a game-loop function, with a series of switch statements based off of the current flags that are ticked

As a start, we can test the agent's ability to what hand it has by starting with all 5 cards revealed. This is important because our current hand can shortcut a bunch of odds-calculations
