@file states-list

This file is a listing of the states which we brainstorm. Even if we are certain they will not be used, they will still be listed. In this case, they are to be prefixed with an X-.

In general, the format will be as follows:
	"<unusable prefix><state name> - <Description><new line><new line>"

This may be changed or added to later to store more information, different information, or change formatting.

"The agent" refers to an arbitrary, but consistent agent

"The agent's opponent" or "the opponent" refers to the other agent

"The pool" refers to the community pool, composed of the flop, turn, and river

-- CUT HERE --

preflop - Before the flop

postflop - After the flop has been revealed

turn - After the turn

river - After the river

betToYou - The bet currently to you. Describes if there's a bet to you greater than 0

{
	aPair - The agent has a pair
	
	cPair - The pool has a pair; May remove later
	
	oPair - The other agent *can* have a pair
	
	X-a2Pair - The agent has, or may have, a pair (May remove this, since it just combines cPair and oPair, which is silly to manage)
}, repeat for all hands

guarenteedWin - Your worst possible hand is better than your opponents best possible hand. This is highly unlikely, as this could only really apply to 4 of a kind or a straight flush. May just ignore this.
